  //        at national level, increased EU-level cooperation and risk management, incident reporting
  //        obligations for operators of essential services and digital service providers.

  //        level and the Directive entered into force in August 2016. The NIS Directive in Article 12 establishes

  //        promote swift and effective operational cooperation” ( <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive" target="_blank" class="NISDirective_link">Full text of the NIS Directive</a> ).`
